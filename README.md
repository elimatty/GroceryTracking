The Grocery Tracking Program was created to read an input file listing various grocery items based on what was purchased in a day, count the number of times the item was purchased, and return how many times a single item was bought, displaying either a numerical value or through a histograph. The part of this program that I feel I did well on, was creating the function CreateDataFile(). This function was able to cut out extra code by creating the required backup file but also created a map of the input file so that I could easily access the information depending on what option the user chose. I could enhance my code by deleting the redundant code in options two and three for looping through the map to assign the item name and quantity with the class's item name and quantity. The looping through the map was the hardest portion I had to write because maps were not a required portion to learn throughout the course and ZyBooks had minimal information regarding them. I looked up many videos and articles to help me iterate through the map, but in doing so, I understand maps fairly well now. Classes are the most transferrable skill that I have learned. Using a class for this project also was the main way this project was maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
